This is our CPT_S_540 course project
The whole process is done using the following files:
1.	N1_Spectral Analysis: In this file, the individual FTIR data files are combined to develop a dataset of 179 datapoints with 3407 features in the excel file named “Dataset O.xlsx” after the data analysis and outlier removal.
2.	N2_Preprocessing: In this file, several preprocessing methods utilized to remove the noise and new preprocessed dataset generated from this step.
3.	N3_Base Models: In this file, all dataset generated from original file and preprocessed are run on base model to get the best model for optimizing in later process.
4.	N4_Feature Selection: In this file, features are selected to reduce the time and space complexity on the best performed datasets.
5.	N5_Feature Extraction: In this file, features extraction was done to reduce the time and space complexity along with more meaning data on the best performed datasets.
6.	N6_Optimization: In this file, the best dataset and model are optimized to produce the result with higher accuracy and lower space and time requirements.
